This is the installation file for the Switchyard package.

Mandatory Prerequisites
-----------------------
Qt v5.9.7 or later.
Cross-platform development toolkit. Available at https://www.qt.io/.

Optional Prerequisites
----------------------
libsndfile
C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound. Needed
for building the 'sycapture' binary in 'tests/'. Available at
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/.

Building the Library
--------------------
Once the prereequites have been installed, the library can be built by means
of the following commands:

./configure
make
make install

The configure script has a number of optional switches to control what gets
built and where things get installed. Do './configure --help' to get a list.

For examples of how to use the library, see the programs in the 'test/'
subdirectory.
